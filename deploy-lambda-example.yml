# This workflow deploys code to an AWS Lambda function using the Lambda GitHub Action.
# It uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate with AWS instead of long-term access keys.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Configure AWS IAM OIDC identity provider for GitHub Actions:
#    - Go to the IAM console, navigate to "Identity providers", and create a new provider
#    - Use https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com as the provider URL
#    - Use sts.amazonaws.com as the audience
#    - Complete the wizard to create the provider
#
# 2. Create an IAM role for GitHub Actions:
#    - Create a new role with Web Identity as the trusted entity
#    - Select the OIDC provider you created above
#    - For "Audience", enter "sts.amazonaws.com"
#    - Add a condition to limit the role to your repository: 
#      token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub: repo:your-org/your-repo:*
#    - Attach policies for Lambda and S3 permissions (Can be found on the README.md)
#
# 3. Replace the value of the required parameters
#    - AWS_REGION
#    - AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME
#    - LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME
#    - LAMBDA_CODE_ARTIFACTS_DIR
#    - LAMBDA_HANDLER
#    - LAMBDA_RUNTIME 
#
# 4. Add any additional parameters under the environment variable section and Deploy Lambda Function step.
#
# 5. Install dependencies and build your source code locally or add a step to do so in the workflow. Below is an example in javascript.
#    name: Install dependencies and build Lambda function
#    run: |
#      npm ci
#      npm run build
